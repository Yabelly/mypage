                    In 2004 I started climbing in my local gym in the
                    Netherlands, I wasn't very naturally gifted for it but a
                    good hobby nontheless. two years later in 2006 I was invited
                    to set a climbing route. Little did I know this would become
                    the primary focus of my adult working career. In the
                    following years I started to study for a bacholor in Social
                    Work at Saxion applied University in Enschede. Although an
                    interesting study I ended up climbing and routesetting most
                    of the time. In 2011 a bouldering gym opened in Enschede
                    which took a large portion of my time. Eventually in 2015 I
                    made the decision to go full-time as a routesetter and
                    joined the Beta-routesetting collective. From then on I
                    spende the next years being a freelance routesetter
                    primarily focussed around bouldering. In these years I ended
                    up setting everything possible in the space of climbing with
                    the exeption of a Worldcup: circuits, competitions from
                    local to international, teamevents, teaching climbing & setting, masterclasses, gymadvising.
                    
                    In 2020 I moved to Berlin and lowered the amount of routesetting mostly thanks to the Covid pandamic. In my time off I decided to turn my attention to web development. That resulted with me undergoing a three month full-time bootcamp at Spiced Academy.
                    This was extremely challeging for me. Sitting behind a desk and thinking in abstract terms was quite the switch from the creative job that is routesetting.
