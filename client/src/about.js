            <section>
                <p>
                    In 2004 I started climbing in my local gym in the
                    Netherlands, I was not very naturally gifted for it but a
                    good hobby nontheless. two years later in 2006 I was invited
                    to set a climbing route. Little did I know this would become
                    the primary focus of my adult working career.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    In the following years I started to study for a bacholor in
                    Social Work at Saxion applied University in Enschede.
                    Although an interesting study I ended up climbing and
                    routesetting most of the time. In 2011 a bouldering gym
                    opened in Enschede which took a large portion of my time.{" "}
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>Eventually in 2015 I made the decision to go
                    full-time as a routesetter and joined the Beta-routesetting
                    collective. From then on I spende the next years being a
                    freelance routesetter primarily focussed around bouldering.
                    In these years I ended up setting everything possible in the
                    space of climbing with the exeption of a Worldcup: circuits,
                    competitions from local to international, teamevents,
                    teaching climbing & setting, masterclasses, gymadvising.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>In 2020 I moved to Berlin and lowered the amount of
                    routesetting mostly thanks to the Covid pandamic. In my time
                    off I decided to turn my attention to web development. That
                    resulted with me undergoing a three month full-time bootcamp
                    at Spiced Academy. It could not be more then 180 degrees on
                    my career. This was extremely challeging for me. Sitting
                    behind a desk and thinking in abstract terms was quite the
                    switch from the creative job that is routesetting. These
                    three months did much more then learn a new skill, it
                    reinvigorated my desire for routesetting taught me to think
                    way more abstract.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br> My next goal is to find a balance between
                    routesetting for my creative and physical needs and work as
                    a web developer to fullfill my intellectual stimulation.
                    Maybe these paths will cross eventually...
